This is a modpack for **Yairm's Unciv**, introducing 4 new unique civilizations with their own unique units and play styles.
## Civilizations:
### Madrea
* A matrineal civilization closely in touch with their spirituality and their surroundings. The Madreans pride themselves as allies of the natural world, and often frowns at the brutality of violence and destruction.

  * Unique Unit: Holy Nymph
  >Although their offensive capability is not impressive, Holy Nymphs derive their efficiency in more defensive purposes and their ability to support other units.
  
  * Unique Building: Nursery
  >To compliment their society, the Nursery is a Madrean-unique building that replaces the monument, providing military units produced in the city to start with experience, enough to acquire their own promotion to supplement their traditionally weak military.

### Freydonia
* A sea-faring civilization led by proud booty-seekers and bountyhunters of fierce predisposition. What they lack in the land area, they make up for it with adequate sea bonuses and advantages.

  * Unique Unit: Sea Rover
  >An elite naval-melee unit, fully geared towards marauding and raiding other sea-going units with ease. Although they fall short when tasked with defensive purposes.
  
  * Unique Unit: Buccaneer
  >Replacing the settler, the Buccaneer is the only token redeeming quality for the Freydonian groundforce. Although no better than a warrior in any regards, Buccaneers can stand up on their own against military units long sufficely enough in the early game. Coupled with their increased movement speed in coastal tiles, Buccaneers are recommended to be used as reconaissance, aggressive settling and hit-n-run tactics against rival civilizations.
  
~~AI still builds settlers as opposed to Buccaneers, seems to be hardcoded which is a shame :(~~

### Cogsvale
* The industry-loving society lead by the financier Sir Magnus. Cogsvale is a civilization primarily focused on outproducing and outpacing their rivals, heading easily for a Scientific victory, although not completely weak from military measures if need be.

  * Unique Unit: Airship
  >A technological wonder of the industrial era, the Cogsvallic Airship is an imposing weapon, able to square up against city defenses and offer support to it's land forces if need be. It's superior vision also gives it suitable patrolling viability.
  
  * Unique Improvement: Factorium
  >The Factorium is the Cogsvale' forerunner advantage over other civilizations. Staying true to the nature of the society, a Factorium can be built in almost any terrain, although not able to improve a resource, the Factorium can bring into hand superior production values to the city it belongs to, with further boosts along the tech tree.
  
### Grunstoll
* A feudal society, grand in their visions of splendor and martial expertise. Clad in gold and silver, the Grunstoll is a civilization looking to push the folder and conquer in the name of it's valiant and patriotic culture.

  * Unique Unit: Casterknight
  > A medieval unit, based on the Grunstollic name for the Castle; the Casterknight excels against other infantry units of it's time, especially in the open field. Although it struggles in more uneven battlefields.
  
  * Unique Building: Round Court
  > A signature piece of culture of the Grunstoll. The Round Court sacrifices gold in exchange for increased national happiness and culture, further fueling and allocating Grunstollic conquests.
